# General TE info

Just a list of some random TE resources and info that I found and don't want to lose track of.

## TE info sheet

[[transposons.xlsx]]
Info I have collected about the TE families annotated by TEUlt and all of the individual programs (sources are listed and there is a page in the excel file that has the reference associated with each number)

## TE links


- [TE Hub](https://tehub.org/): this website is so amazing, a huge wiki site full of transposon related resources
- [Dfam info about DNA TEs](https://www.dfam.org/classification/dna-termini): contains a very helpful chart including consensus sequences for termini, and the 5' and 3' ends of various TE subclasses
- [Dfam TE Classification](https://www.dfam.org/classification/tree): interactive classification tree that dissects and visualizes the classification system used by Dfam for TEs
- [Ten things you should know about transposable elements](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1577-z)

# General TE info

Just a list of some random TE resources and info that I have found helpful throughout all of this.

## TE info sheet

[[transposons.xlsx]]
Info I have collected about the TE families annotated by TEUlt and all of the individual programs (sources are listed and there is a page in the excel file that has the reference associated with each number)

## TE links

- [Dfam info about DNA TEs](https://www.dfam.org/classification/dna-termini)
  - contains a very helpful chart including consensus sequences for termini, and the 5' and 3' ends of various TE subclasses
- [Dfam TE Classification](https://www.dfam.org/classification/tree)
  - interactive classification tree that dissects and visualizes the classification system used by Dfam for TEs
- [Ten things you should know about transposable elements](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1577-z)
  - great article that covers the basics of TEs

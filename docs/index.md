# Transposon Annotations and Mapping Process
%%This is the only way I could figure out how to publish this Obsidian vault with all of the transposon annotation and mapping workflow information in a way that is actually helpful to others.%%
This website is just my notes and process for generating transposon annotations and then tracking their movement during SPUR 2022 (Summer 2022). There are 2 main parts:
1. [[a0_overall_anno_workflow|overall annotation workflow]]
2. [[m0_overall_mapping_workflow|overall mapping workflow]]
and each of these pages have subpages that outline the general steps I took for each portion of this process! Hopefully this makes sense to somebody other than me :) let me know if you need any information from me- I will continue to update this site as I think of more information and steps that need explaining

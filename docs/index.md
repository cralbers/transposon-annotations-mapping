# Transposon Annotations and Mapping Process

This website is just my notes and process for generating transposon annotations and then tracking their movement during SPUR (Summer 2022). There are 2 main parts:

1. [[a0_overall_anno_workflow|overall annotation workflow]]
2. [[m0_overall_mapping_workflow|overall mapping workflow]]

Each of these pages have subpages that outline the general steps I took for each portion of this process! Hopefully this makes sense to somebody other than me :) 


* Also the github link in the top right corner links to a repo with all of the code I mention in here, as well as my edited TEUlt source code and documentation for the individual programs
